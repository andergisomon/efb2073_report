But an issue with the IoT based project is the low privacy, due to the need of a server and internet. Hardly discussing this matter, our team ended up concluding that we can solve this problem. There comes the main feature of our project, where we DO NOT need access to internet, NOR a server. Our projectâ€™s main feature is the use of ESP-NOW, which is a wireless communication protocol developed by Espressif that features short packet transmission. This protocol enables multiple devices to talk to each other using Wi-Fi with ESP-NOW protocol. This is a fast communication protocol that can be used to exchange small messages (up to 250 bytes) between ESP32 boards. ESP-NOW is very versatile and can have one-way or two-way communication in different arrangements.\nIn many industrial, commercial, and residential applications, traditional wired switches are still widely used for controlling various systems and devices, mostly turn ON or OFF a certain system or device. With our wireless system switches, one is now able to update the system to a wireless switch system, then being able to perform the same operations as the wired system, but now wireless.\nProblem Statement Wired systems are less adaptable to changing requirements and can be inconvenient for users who need to control devices from different locations, this issue highlights the need for a universal wireless system that can be integrated as an update to a wired system already existing.\nObjectives To update currently wired switches by wireless switches To enable users to control their devices from multiple location through wireless transmission To use local transmission for private IoT applications/environment ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/intro/","summary":"Project Background, Problem Statement, Objectives","title":"Introduction"},{"content":"Hardware selection Materials used in this project:\nESP32C3 LEDs Buzzer Note: LEDs and Buzzer are just for demonstration purposes, as we want to demonstrate how our module works, the LEDs and Buzzer may be replaced by any other industrial device or appliance.\nFeatures ESP32C ESP 8266 STM32 with Wi-Fi Module ESP-NOW Protocol Support Native support No native support Typically unsupported Power Efficiency High, supports deep sleep modes Moderate, less efficient Varies, generally less efficient Performance and Features High, RISC-V architecture Moderate, Tensilica Xtensa Varies, depends on configuration Development Ecosystem and Community Support Extensive, strong community Good, less advanced Strong for STM32, complex configuration Cost and Availability Cost-effective Cheaper, fewer features More expensive, complex integration Hardware design Transmitter Receiver The ESP-NOW protocol requires that two ESP32C3, one to act as a transmitter and another as a receiver. To support the wireless module the ESP32C3 was also connected to an antennae extension. The transmitter is wired to accept input from 3 switches, each button when pressed would toggle the associated pins on the receiver sides. The receiver is wired to 3 LEDs and when data is received from the transmitter, it would toggle the associated pins either from (HIGH to LOW) or (LOW to HIGH). The 3 LEDS, are just to indicate switching.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/hardware/","summary":"Hardware selection, Harware design","title":"Hardware Development Process"},{"content":"Flowchart Receiver Transmitter Discussion Technical challenges faced Overcoming the challenges ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/development_process/","summary":"Further discussion, technical challenges, and how we had overcome them","title":"Software development process"},{"content":"End product There are no words that best describe our promising project, so let us demonstrate our end product in action in the following video:\n(Youtube video here)\nApplications The Module serves as a very flexible attachment to any control systems that require switching. A receiver and transmitter are only required to establish the Intranet system. An example of application of the module would be in a relay circuit as the switch relay as shown below. The receiver would interact with the switch to enable the power of any high-powered system without being connected to the board and potentially frying it.\nOur Multipurpose IoT Automation with RISC-V project can be implemented in endless scenarios, examples of application in the industry for this relay circuit would be::\nPublic Transport - Sexual harassment alarm, vehicle access, etc. Home Automation - Light control, security systems, etc. Industrial Application - Machine control, process monitoring, etc. Health Care - Patient room control, emergency systems, etc. Agriculture - Irrigation control, greenhouse automation, etc. Conclusion Recommenadations ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/results/","summary":"See our end product in action, conclusion, and future recommendations","title":"Project Outomes \u0026 Accomplishments"},{"content":" Some C code for your viewing pleasure.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #include \u0026#34;freertos.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026lt;drivers/gpio.h\u0026gt; // I\u0026#39;m a comment.
