## Project Background
> Thinking on development and implementation of a real world-based project together with complexity of a system, we decided that we should definitely make an IoT project. But an issue with the IoT based project is the low privacy, due to the need of a server and internet. Hardly discussing this matter, our team ended up concluding that we can solve this problem. There comes the main feature of our project, where we DO NOT need access to internet, NOR a server.
Our projectâ€™s main feature is the use of ESP-NOW, which is a wireless communication protocol developed by Espressif that features short packet transmission. This protocol enables multiple devices to talk to each other using Wi-Fi with ESP-NOW protocol. This is a fast communication protocol that can be used to exchange small messages (up to 250 bytes) between ESP32 boards. ESP-NOW is very versatile and  can have one-way or two-way communication in different arrangements.

> In many industrial, commercial, and residential applications, traditional wired switches are still widely used for controlling various systems and devices, mostly turn ON or OFF a certain system or device. With our wireless system switches, one is now able to update the system to a wireless switch system, then being able to perform the same operations as the wired system, but now wireless.

## Problem Statement
> Wired systems are less adaptable to changing requirements and can be inconvenient for users who need to control devices from different locations, this issue highlights the need for a universal wireless system that can be integrated as an update to a wired system already existing.


## Objectives
> - To update currently wired switches by wireless switches
> - To enable users to control their devices from multiple location through wireless transmission
> - To use local transmission for private IoT applications/environment
